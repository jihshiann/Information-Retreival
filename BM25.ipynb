Of 845 high school students who participated in the baseline survey , 804 ( 95 % ) completed a postintervention questionnaire . An AIDS prevention program was developed by public high school teachers together with local AIDS experts , social scientists and health educators . The teacher-led AIDS program was designed to provide students with accurate information about AIDS , particularly in dispelling misconceptions about casual contagion , to foster positive attitudes towards people with AIDS and to develop skills aimed at clarifying values and assessing intended behavior . At baseline , 11 % of students ( 20 % of males and 4 % of females ) reported ever having had sexual intercourse ( mean age 14 years ) . Among these , condom use was low ( 24 % ) . After implementation of the AIDS prevention program , statistically significant effects favoring the intervention group were observed in knowledge and attitudes towards people with AIDS . While there was no statistically significant overall effect on intended preventive behavior , the program appeared to delay the students ' intended onset of sexual activity . A sizable number of Filipino high school students are sexually active but condom use is low . School-based AIDS prevention programs can be developed and implemented in developing countries with the assistance of school personnel to address sexual issues . Our program was successful in increasing AIDS-related knowledge and improving attitudes towards people with AIDS .

The results of this study confirm the effectiveness of an AIDS education program for physical therapy students at this institution . Further study of entry-level graduate physical therapy students , licensed physical therapists , and other allied health professionals is needed to determine whether the education of these groups can affect their knowledge and attitudes toward patients with AIDS .

The ASK ( AIDS Survey for Kids ) , a standardized , semistructured interview that measures conceptual understanding , factual information , and fears about AIDS , was administered before and after the intervention .

These results were unaffected by controlling for grade , gender , race , socioeconomic status , and verbal fluency . The gains in children 's understanding of causality of AIDS represented at least 2 years ' growth in the level of conceptual sophistication and persisted at a follow-up evaluation several months later . After the intervention , more children ( P < .001 ) in the intervention group than in the control group accurately identified causes of AIDS in response to open-ended questions : germ/germ theory ( 41 % vs 13 % ) , mother-to-infant transmission ( 54 % vs 15 % ) , blood transmission ( 83 % vs 40 % ) , and sexual transmission ( 56 % vs 30 % ) .

Previous trials of decision aids to increase SDM and CRC screening uptake have yielded mixed results . To assess the impact of decision aid-assisted SDM on CRC screening uptake . RCT . The study was conducted at an urban , academic safety-net hospital and community health center between 2005 and 2010 . Participants were asymptomatic , average-risk patients aged 50-75 years due for CRC screening . Study participants ( n = 825 ) were randomized to one of two intervention arms ( decision aid plus personalized risk assessment or decision aid alone ) or control arm . The interventions took place just prior to a routine office visit with their primary care providers . The primary outcome was completion of a CRC screening test within 12 months of the study visit . Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of test completion and mediators of the intervention effect . Analysis was completed in 2011 . Patients in the decision-aid group were more likely to complete a screening test than control patients ( 43.1 % vs 34.8 % , p = 0.046 ) within 12 months of the study visit ; conversely , test uptake for the decision aid and decision aid plus personalized risk assessment arms was similar ( 43.1 % vs 37.1 % , p = 0.15 ) . Assignment to the decision-aid arm ( AOR = 1.48 , 95 % CI = 1.04 , 2.10 ) , black race ( AOR = 1.52 , 95 % CI = 1.12 , 2.06 ) and a preference for a patient-dominant decision-making approach ( AOR = 1.55 , 95 % CI = 1.02 , 2.35 ) were independent determinants of test completion . Activation of the screening discussion and enhanced screening intentions mediated the intervention effect . Decision aid-assisted SDM has a modest impact on CRC screening uptake . A decision aid plus personalized risk assessment tool is no more effective than a decision aid alone . This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.govNCT00251862 . '}\n"

A two-group randomized clinical trial compared a smoking cessation intervention delivered by cellular telephone with usual care approach . Current smokers from a large , inner city HIV/AIDS care center were recruited and randomized to receive either usual care or a cellular telephone intervention . The usual care group received brief physician advice to quit smoking , targeted self-help written materials and nicotine replacement therapy . The cellular telephone intervention received eight counseling sessions delivered via cellular telephone in addition to the usual care components . Smoking-related outcomes were assessed at a 3-month follow-up . The trial had 95 participants and 77 ( 81.0 % ) completed the 3-month follow-up assessment . Analyses indicated biochemically verified point prevalence smoking abstinence rates of 10.3 % for the usual care group and 36.8 % for the cellular telephone group ; participants who received the cellular telephone intervention were 3.6 times ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.3-9 .9 ) more likely to quit smoking compared with participants who received usual care ( P = 0.0059 ) . These results suggest that individuals living with HIV/AIDS are receptive to , and can be helped by , smoking cessation treatment . In addition , smoking cessation treatment tailored to the special needs of individuals living with HIV/AIDS , such as counseling delivered by cellular telephone , can significantly increase smoking abstinence rates over that achieved by usual care .

The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale , the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , the Clinical Global Impression scale , and the SAFETEE general inquiry ( for safety and tolerability ) were administered at weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 12 . Fifty-six ( 75 % ) of the 75 patients completed 6 weeks and 34 ( 45 % ) completed 12 weeks of the trial . The mean daily doses of both paroxetine ( 33.9 mg ) and imipramine ( 162.5 mg ) were significantly more effective than placebo ; they were comparably effective at weeks 6 , 8 , and 12 according to the intent-to-treat analysis and at week 8 according to the analysis for the subjects who completed the trial ( for them , only imipramine was superior to placebo at week 12 ) . There were significantly more dropouts due to side effects from imipramine ( 48 % ) than from both paroxetine ( 20 % ) and placebo ( 24 % ) . Depressed patients with HIV infection responded to imipramine or paroxetine at a higher rate than to placebo irrespective of severity of immunosuppression . Because paroxetine was much better tolerated than imipramine , its overall effectiveness may be greater . However , because of the small study group and the high attrition rate , these findings can not be generalized and may need replication in a larger study group . '}\n",

The patients were randomly assigned to receive either foscarnet ( 40 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 8 hours ) or vidarabine ( 15 mg per kilogram per day intravenously ) for 10 to 42 days . In the isolates of herpes simplex virus we documented in vitro resistance to acyclovir and susceptibility to foscarnet and vidarabine . The lesions in all eight patients assigned to foscarnet healed completely after 10 to 24 days of therapy . In contrast , vidarabine was discontinued because of failure in all six patients assigned to receive it . The time to complete healing ( P = 0.01 ) , time to 50 percent reductions in the size of the lesions ( P = 0.01 ) and the pain score ( P = 0.004 ) , and time to the end of viral shedding ( P = 0.006 ) were all significantly shorter in the patients assigned to foscarnet . Three patients had new neurologic abnormalities while receiving vidarabine . No patient discontinued foscarnet because of toxicity . Although initial recurrences of herpes simplex infection after the index lesion had healed tended to be susceptible to acyclovir , acyclovir-resistant infection eventually recurred in every healed patient , a median of 42.5 days ( range , 14 to 191 ) after foscarnet was discontinued . For the treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex infection in patients with AIDS , foscarnet has superior efficacy and less frequent serious toxicity than vidarabine .

The double-blind , randomized 15-day trial was divided into a 3-day period in which solid food was consumed followed by a 12-day experimental period in which liquid formulas were consumed . Twenty-three men and one woman with AIDS and fat malabsorption completed the study . The study was conducted in the General Clinical Research Center , University of Alabama Hospital , University of Alabama at Birmingham . Laboratory assays were performed in the Department of Nutrition Sciences . After 3 days of consuming a controlled , solid food diet containing 100 g fat per day from mixed sources to document fat malabsorption , subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups . Each group received a liquid formula containing 35 % of energy as fat for 12 days . One group received a formula containing 85 % medium-chain triglycerides ( MCTs ) and the control group received a formula containing 100 % long-chain triglycerides . Determinations included stool number , consistency , weight , and fat and nitrogen content ; urine nitrogen and creatinine levels ; and body weight . Subject demographic and other baseline characteristics were compared using two-sample t tests ; stool and urine assessments were compared between groups at the initial experimental period using two-sample t tests ; changes from initial to final experimental periods were assessed by means of analysis of covariance ; changes in pooled intake , body weight , and the number and consistency of bowel movements were also assessed using analysis of covariance . All statistical tests were two-tailed and considered significant at P < .05 . Within-group comparisons indicated that subjects fed the MCT formula showed significantly decreased stool fat and stool nitrogen content ( P = .01 and P = .03 , respectively ) and increased fat absorption ( P = .03 ) , whereas those fed the control formula did not . Differences in stool fat between the groups were not statistically significant . However , the difference in fat absorption from the initial to final formula period was significant ( P = .04 ) . Subjects consuming the MCT formula also tended to have a decreased number of bowel movements and abdominal symptoms , whereas subjects fed the control formula showed no improvement .

Results were achieved by enhancing structural social capital through ministry participation , religious values and norms , linking trust and by reducing negative religious coping . High intervention attendance may indicate the feasibility of conducting faith-based HIV prevention research for African American women .

Our objective was to characterise the population pharmacokinetics of delavirdine in HIV-infected patients who participated in the adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) 260 and 261 studies . ACTG 261 was a randomised , double-blind study of delavirdine 400mg three times daily , in various combination regimens ; ACTG 260 was a concentration-targeted monotherapy study . Two hundred and thirty-four patients , and 1254 and 1251 plasma concentrations for delavirdine and N-delavirdine , respectively , were available for population pharmacokinetic analysis . The pharmacokinetic model ( and initial parameters ) , based on previous studies , included two compartments for delavirdine ( peripheral and central ) and parallel clearance pathways ( nonlinear conversion to N-delavirdine and first order clearance from the body ) . The model was one compartment for N-delavirdine with first order clearance . Diurnal variation of delavirdine and N-delavirdine oral clearance was modelled as a cosine function , with amplitude variation a fitted parameter . Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were derived from iterative two-stage analysis ; observed delavirdine and N-delavirdine concentrations fit with weighting by the inverse observation variance . Covariates were analysed by multiple general linear modelling . The mean ( percent coefficient of variation [ % CV ] ) CD4 count was 315 ( 109 ) cells/mm ( 3 ) , weight 76.9 ( 14.7 ) kg , age 37 ( 8.5 ) years , and 15 % of the population were women . Mean ( % CV ) population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for delavirdine were : volume of distribution at steady state 67.6 ( 100 ) L , intrinsic oral clearance 19.8 ( 64 ) L/h , concentration at half the maximum velocity of metabolism ( V ( max ) ) 6.3 ( 69 ) micromol/L and first order oral clearance 0.57 ( 86 ) L/h . For N-delavirdine , the mean ( % CV ) apparent volume of distribution was 24.7 ( 75 ) L and apparent clearance 29.7 ( 42 ) L/h . The mean V ( max ) was 1376 ( 68 ) mg/day . The final model for average intrinsic clearance of delavirdine included race , sex , weight and age as significant covariates ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , these covariates do not explain a significant proportion of the overall variability in the population . Delavirdine disposition exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics and large interpatient variability , and is significantly altered by time of day ( impacting potential therapeutic drug monitoring and future pharmacokinetic study designs ) . Although race and sex appear to influence delavirdine pharmacokinetics , men and women and patients of different races should receive similar mg/kg dosage regimens . The presence of large interpatient variability supports the further investigation of the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring for delavirdine , if target drug concentrations can be better defined .
