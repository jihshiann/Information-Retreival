A cluster-randomized , controlled trial with pretest/post-test evaluation was conducted in four demographically similar public high schools in a semi-urban district of Metro Manila , the Philippines . Of 845 high school students who participated in the baseline survey , 804 ( 95 % ) completed a postintervention questionnaire . An AIDS prevention program was developed by public high school teachers together with local AIDS experts , social scientists and health educators . The teacher-led AIDS program was designed to provide students with accurate information about AIDS , particularly in dispelling misconceptions about casual contagion , to foster positive attitudes towards people with AIDS and to develop skills aimed at clarifying values and assessing intended behavior . At baseline , 11 % of students ( 20 % of males and 4 % of females ) reported ever having had sexual intercourse ( mean age 14 years ) . Among these , condom use was low ( 24 % ) . After implementation of the AIDS prevention program , statistically significant effects favoring the intervention group were observed in knowledge and attitudes towards people with AIDS . While there was no statistically significant overall effect on intended preventive behavior , the program appeared to delay the students ' intended onset of sexual activity . A sizable number of Filipino high school students are sexually active but condom use is low . School-based AIDS prevention programs can be developed and implemented in developing countries with the assistance of school personnel to address sexual issues . Our program was successful in increasing AIDS-related knowledge and improving attitudes towards people with AIDS . Supplementation with other preventive activities may be needed to achieve lasting changes in students ' risk-taking behavior . "}

In order to identify parameters which promote or impede the use of hearing aids , a questionnaire-based survey was conducted . A total of 35 randomly chosen , hard of hearing adults indicated for a hearing aid were examined . The importance of speech in quiet and in noise , wearing comfort , sound quality , appearance and costs , as well as expectations , willingness to use a hearing aid and reasons for and against provision were determined . Speech in noise and quiet were most important , followed by comfort of wearing and appearance of the aid . Expectations towards the hearing aids were in general high . The willingness to use hearing devices was positively affected by the expectation that it would improve quality of life and negatively by the amount of social activity of the person . The main reasons against the use of hearing aids were appearance and lack of confidence in hearing aid technology . This pilot-study identified several parameters which might affect willingness to use hearing aids . In particular , expectations towards the aids , personal attitude towards hearing and communication problems and the appearance of hearing aids should be subject to further examination . '}

A sample of convenience of 103 entry-level undergraduate junior physical therapy students , aged 20 to 35 years ( mean = 22.1 , SD = 2.8 ) , from one class at one institution participated in this study . A two-group pretest-posttest with control group delayed-intervention design was used . Subjects were randomly assigned to either a group that received an AIDS education unit ( experimental group ) or a group that did not receive a special education unit ( control group ) . All subjects were pretested and posttested together with a modified version of the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Nursing AIDS Study Questionnaire . Willingness to treat patients who have AIDS was assessed based on self-report responses . After the pretest of both groups , the experimental group received an AIDS education unit followed by the posttest , whereas the control group received no AIDS education unit before the posttest . The experimental group showed significant improvement of knowledge , attitudes , and willingness to treat patients who have AIDS as a result of the AIDS education unit . The control group showed no significant change or a lowered score and thus a change in a nondesired direction . The results of this study confirm the effectiveness of an AIDS education program for physical therapy students at this institution . Further study of entry-level graduate physical therapy students , licensed physical therapists , and other allied health professionals is needed to determine whether the education of these groups can affect their knowledge and attitudes toward patients with AIDS . Improved knowledge and attitudes of the health care provider with an increased willingness to treat patients who have AIDS ensures these patients will receive optimal and appropriate health care . "}

We found eight encounters involving six clinicians who did not use the decision aid as intended either by not using it at all ( n = 5 ; one clinician did use the decision aid in three encounters ) , offering inaccurate quantitative and probabilistic information about the risks and benefits of statins ( n = 2 ) , or using the decision aid to advance the agenda that all patients with diabetes should take statin ( n = 1 ) . Clinicians used the decision aid as intended in all other encounters . Unintended decision aid use in the context of videotaped encounters in a practical randomized trial was common . These instances offer insights to researchers seeking to design and implement effective decision aids for use during the clinical visit , particularly when clinicians may prefer to proceed in ways that the decision aid apparently contradicts .

Thirty-six older adults with hearing impairment participated in this study . Twelve were fitted with bilateral hearing aids simultaneously . The remaining participants were fitted sequentially : One hearing aid ( to the left or to the right ear ) was used initially ; 1 month later , the other ear was also fitted with a hearing aid for bilateral use . Self-reports on usefulness and compliance were elicited after the first and second months of hearing aid use . In addition , the number of hours the hearing aids were used was extracted from the data loggings of each device . Simultaneous fitting resulted in high levels of compliance and consistent usage throughout the study period . Sequential fitting resulted in abrupt reduction in compliance and hours of use once the second hearing aid was added , both in the clinical scoring and in the data loggings . Simultaneous fitting of bilateral hearing aids results in better compliance compared with sequential fitting . The addition of a second hearing aid after a relatively short period of monaural use may lead to inconsistent use of both hearing aids . '}

 {'id': '20003515', 'contents': 'Hearing impairment is the most common body system disability in veterans . In 2008 , nearly 520,000 veterans had a disability for hearing loss through the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) . Changes in eligibility for hearing aid services , along with the aging population , contributed to a greater than 300 % increase in the number of hearing aids dispensed from 1996 to 2006 . In 2006 , the VA committed to having no wait times for patient visits while providing quality clinically-appropriate care . One approach to achieving this goal is the use of group visits as an alternative to individual visits . We sought to determine : 1 ) if group hearing aid fitting and follow-up visits were at least as effective as individual visits , and 2 ) whether group visits lead to cost savings through the six month period after the hearing aid fitting . We describe the rationale , design , and characteristics of the baseline cohort of the first randomized clinical trial to study the impact of group versus individual hearing aid fitting and follow-up visits . Participants were recruited from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System Audiology Clinic . Eligible patients had no previous hearing aid use and monaural or binaural air-conduction hearing aids were ordered at the evaluation visit . Participants were randomized to receive the hearing aid fitting and the hearing aid follow-up in an individual or group visit . The primary outcomes were hearing-related function , measured with the first module of the Effectiveness of Aural Rehabilitation ( Inner EAR ) , and hearing aid adherence . We tracked the total cost of planned and unplanned audiology visits over the 6-month interval after the hearing aid fitting . A cohort of 659 participants was randomized to receive group or individual hearing aid fitting and follow-up visits . Baseline demographic and self-reported health status and hearing-related measures were evenly distributed across the treatment arms.Outcomes after the 6-month follow-up period are needed to determine if group visits were as least as good as those for individual visits and will be reported in subsequent publication .

This study aims to determine whether AIDS education in the elementary grades can advance young children 's understanding of this illness . A randomized , controlled trial was used to measure the impact of a 3-week , multifaceted AIDS education program on conceptual understanding , factual knowledge , and fears about AIDS in 189 students in grades kindergarten through 6th . The ASK ( AIDS Survey for Kids ) , a standardized , semistructured interview that measures conceptual understanding , factual information , and fears about AIDS , was administered before and after the intervention . Children in the intervention group , as compared to those in the control group , showed significant ( P < .0001 ) gains in their level of understanding of the concepts of causality and prevention of AIDS . These results were unaffected by controlling for grade , gender , race , socioeconomic status , and verbal fluency . The gains in children 's understanding of causality of AIDS represented at least 2 years ' growth in the level of conceptual sophistication and persisted at a follow-up evaluation several months later . After the intervention , more children ( P < .001 ) in the intervention group than in the control group accurately identified causes of AIDS in response to open-ended questions : germ/germ theory ( 41 % vs 13 % ) , mother-to-infant transmission ( 54 % vs 15 % ) , blood transmission ( 83 % vs 40 % ) , and sexual transmission ( 56 % vs 30 % ) . Fewer than half as many children in the intervention group responded incorrectly to each of five direct questions about transmission of HIV through casual contact . The intervention did not increase children 's fears about the illness . A short , developmentally based , multifaceted AIDS education program in the elementary grades can advance children 's conceptual understanding and factual knowledge about AIDS and decrease their misconceptions about casual contact as a means of acquiring the illness , without increasing their fears . Significant advances in conceptual understanding about AIDS can be achieved through direct educational interventions . "}

Previous trials of decision aids to increase SDM and CRC screening uptake have yielded mixed results . To assess the impact of decision aid-assisted SDM on CRC screening uptake . RCT . The study was conducted at an urban , academic safety-net hospital and community health center between 2005 and 2010 . Participants were asymptomatic , average-risk patients aged 50-75 years due for CRC screening . Study participants ( n = 825 ) were randomized to one of two intervention arms ( decision aid plus personalized risk assessment or decision aid alone ) or control arm . The interventions took place just prior to a routine office visit with their primary care providers . The primary outcome was completion of a CRC screening test within 12 months of the study visit . Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of test completion and mediators of the intervention effect . Analysis was completed in 2011 . Patients in the decision-aid group were more likely to complete a screening test than control patients ( 43.1 % vs 34.8 % , p = 0.046 ) within 12 months of the study visit ; conversely , test uptake for the decision aid and decision aid plus personalized risk assessment arms was similar ( 43.1 % vs 37.1 % , p = 0.15 ) .
