METHODS\tPublic primary schools in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions , Tanzania . METHODS\tA total of 2026 sixth and seventh grade pupils ( average age , 14.0 years ) participated at baseline ( 85 % ) and 1785 at follow-up . METHODS\tThe program was designed to reduce children 's risk of HIV infection and to improve their tolerance of and care for people with AIDS . METHODS\tLocal teachers and health workers attended a 1-week training workshop before implementing the program over a 2-3-month period ( averaging 20 school hours per class ) . METHODS\tSelf-reported exposure to AIDS information , communication regarding AIDS ; AIDS knowledge , attitudes towards people with AIDS , attitudes towards having sexual intercourse , subjective norms regarding sexual intercourse , and intention to engage in sexual intercourse . RESULTS\tFollowing this program , intervention pupils reported significantly higher scores for the following outcome measures than pupils attending the comparison schools : AIDS information ( 13.1 versus 10.5 ; P = 0.0001 ) , AIDS communication ( 10.9 versus 7.8 ; P = 0.0001 ) AIDS knowledge ( 14.5 versus 11.5 ; P = 0.0001 ) , attitudes towards people with AIDS ( 9.0 versus 6.7 ; P = 0.0008 ) , subjective norms ( 45.5 versus 43.9 ; P = 0.011 ) , and intention ( 1.3 versus 1.4 ; P = 0.020 ) .

BACKGROUND\tIncreasing this threshold has been proposed , with a primary goal of reducing HIV-1 infectiousness . BACKGROUND\tBecause the quantity of HIV-1 in plasma is the primary predictor of HIV-1 transmission , consideration of plasma viral load in ART initiation guidelines is warranted . METHODS\tUsing per-sex-act infectivity estimates and cross-sectional sexual behavior data from 2,484 HIV-1 infected persons with CD4 counts > 350 enrolled in a study of African heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples , we calculated the number of transmissions expected and the number potentially averted under selected scenarios for ART initiation : i ) CD4 count < 500 cells/L , ii ) viral load 10,000 or 50,000 copies/mL and iii ) universal treatment . METHODS\tFor each scenario , we estimated the proportion of expected infections that could be averted , the proportion of infected persons initiating treatment , and the ratio of these proportions . RESULTS\tInitiating treatment at viral load 50,000 copies/mL would require treating 19.8 % of infected persons with CD4 counts > 350 while averting 40.5 % of expected transmissions ( ratio 2.0 ) ; treating at viral load 10,0000 copies/mL had a ratio of 1.5 . RESULTS\tIn contrast , initiation at CD4 count < 500 would require treating 41.8 % , while averting 48.4 % ( ratio 1.1 ) .

BACKGROUND\tUnderstanding correlates of STIs among discordant couples will aid in optimizing interventions to prevent HIV-1 transmission in these couples . METHODS\tHIV-1-discordant couples in which HIV-1-infected partners were HSV-2-seropositive were tested for syphilis , chlamydia , gonorrhea , and trichomoniasis , and HIV-1-uninfected partners were tested for HSV-2 . METHODS\tWe assessed sociodemographic , behavioral , and biological correlates of a current STI . RESULTS\tOf 416 couples enrolled , 16 % were affected by a treatable STI , and among these both partners were infected in 17 % of couples . RESULTS\tA treatable STI was found in 46 ( 11 % ) females and 30 ( 7 % ) males . RESULTS\tThe most prevalent infections were trichomoniasis ( 5.9 % ) and syphilis ( 2.6 % ) . RESULTS\tParticipants were 5.9-fold more likely to have an STI if their partner had an STI ( P < 0.01 ) , and STIs were more common among those reporting any unprotected sex ( OR = 2.43 ; P < 0.01 ) and those with low education ( OR = 3.00 ; P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS\tAmong HIV-1-uninfected participants with an HSV-2-seropositive partner , females were significantly more likely to be HSV-2-seropositive than males ( 78 % versus 50 % , P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS\tTreatable STIs were common among HIV-1-discordant couples and the majority of couples affected by an STI were discordant for the STI , with relatively high HSV-2 discordance .

            "BACKGROUND\tAIDS-defining events ( ADEs ) decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy but still lead to hospitalizations and deaths . BACKGROUND\tUnderstanding factors related to ADEs is important to mitigate events . METHODS\tWe examined the relationship between demographics , behaviors , comorbidities , laboratory , clinical measurements , and ADEs diagnosed among subjects randomized to antiretroviral treatments ( ART ) / strategies and followed prospectively . METHODS\tLogistic regression models using generalized estimating equations generated odds ratios ( ORs ) focusing on the relationship between current CD4 T-cell count ( CD4 ) / HIV-1 RNA viral load ( VL ) and ADEs in the subsequent 16-week study period . RESULTS\tAmong the 2948 subjects in the analysis , overall incidence of ADEs was 1.53 per 100 person-years . RESULTS\tMultivariate regression models adjusted for demographics , body mass index , and ADE history . RESULTS\tA 6-level time-varying variable examined VL ( > 100,000 copies/mL , < or = 100,000 ) at CD4 levels ( 0-50 , 51-200 , > 200 cells/microL ) ; reference level was CD4 > 200/VL < or = 100,000 . RESULTS\tAmong ART naives , odds of having an ADE in the subsequent 16-week interval were greater among subjects with lower CD4 counts ; this relationship was modified by VL level ( CD4 < or = 50/VL > 100,000 : OR 37.2 ; CD4 < or = 50/VL < or = 100,000 : OR 30.5 ; CD4 51-200 / VL > 100,000 : OR 13.0 ; CD4 51-200 / VL < or = 100,000 : OR 4.5 ; all P values < 0.001 ) . RESULTS\tSimilar results were seen among ART-experienced subjects . CONCLUSIONS\tRecent CD4 and VL values are closely associated with development of ADEs even after examining a multitude of potential factors .\n",

            "BACKGROUND\tDespite recent decreases in HIV incidence in many sub-Saharan African countries , there is little evidence that specific behavioural interventions have led to a reduction in HIV among young people . BACKGROUND\tFurther and wider-scale decreases in HIV require better understanding of when behaviour change occurs and why . BACKGROUND\tThe MEMA kwa Vijana adolescent sexual and reproductive health intervention has been implemented in rural Mwanza , Tanzania since 1999 . BACKGROUND\tA long-term evaluation in 2007/8 found that the intervention improved knowledge , attitudes to sex and some reported risk behaviours , but not HIV or HSV2 prevalence . BACKGROUND\tThe aim of this paper was to assess the differential impact of the intervention according to gender , age , marital status , number of years of exposure and time since last exposure to the intervention . METHODS\tIn 2007 , a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the 20 trial communities among 13,814 young people ( 15-30 yrs ) who had attended intervention or comparison schools between 1999 and 2002 . METHODS\tOutcomes for which the intervention had an impact in 2001 or 2007 were included in this subgroup analysis . METHODS\tData were analysed using cluster-level methods for stratified cluster-randomised trials , using interaction tests to determine if intervention impact differed by subgroup . RESULTS\tTaking into account multiplicity of testing , concurrence with a priori hypotheses and consistency within the results no strong effect-modifiers emerged . RESULTS\tImpact on pregnancy knowledge and reported attitudes to sex increased with years of exposure to high-quality intervention . CONCLUSIONS\tThe desirable long-term impact of the MEMA kwa Vijana intervention did not vary greatly according to the subgroups examined . CONCLUSIONS\tThis suggests that the intervention can have an impact on a broad cross-section of young people in rural Mwanza . BACKGROUND\tClinicalTrials.gov NCT00248469 .\n",

            "OBJECTIVE\tThis article examines gender differences in attitudes toward sexual risk-taking behaviors of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) - orphaned youth participating in a randomized control trial testing an economic empowerment intervention in rural Uganda . METHODS\tAdolescents ( average age 13.7 years ) who had lost one or both parents to AIDS from 15 comparable schools were randomly assigned to either an experimental ( n = 135 ) or a control condition ( n = 142 ) . METHODS\tAdolescents in the experimental condition , in addition to usual care , also received support and incentives to save money toward secondary education . RESULTS\tFindings indicate that although adolescent boys and girls within the experimental condition saved comparable amounts , the intervention appears to have benefited girls , in regard to the attitudes toward sexual risk-taking behavior , in a different way and to a lesser extent than boys . CONCLUSIONS\tFuture research should investigate the possibility that adolescent girls might be able to develop equally large improvements in protective attitudes toward sexual risk taking through additional components that address gendered social norms .\n",

            "BACKGROUND\tThere is a lack of effective behavioral interventions for HIV-positive injection drug users ( IDUs ) . BACKGROUND\tWe sought to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to reduce sexual and injection transmission risk behaviors and to increase utilization of medical care and adherence to HIV medications among this population . METHODS\tHIV-positive IDUs ( n = 966 ) recruited in 4 US cities were randomly assigned to a 10-session peer mentoring intervention or to an 8-session video discussion intervention ( control condition ) . METHODS\tParticipants completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews and had their blood drawn to measure CD4 cell count and viral load at baseline and at 3-month ( no blood ) , 6-month , and 12-month follow-ups . RESULTS\tOverall retention rates for randomized participants were 87 % , 83 % , and 85 % at 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively . RESULTS\tParticipants in both conditions reported significant reductions from baseline in injection and sexual transmission risk behaviors , but there were no significant differences between conditions . RESULTS\tParticipants in both conditions reported no change in medical care and adherence , and there were no significant differences between conditions . CONCLUSIONS\tBoth interventions led to decreases in risk behaviors but no changes in medical outcomes . CONCLUSIONS\tThe characteristics of the trial that may have contributed to these results are examined , and directions for future research are identified .\n",
