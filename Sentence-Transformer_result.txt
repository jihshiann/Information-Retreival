OBJECTIVE	To test the effects of an HIV/AIDS education program . METHODS	A quasi-experimental , nested cross-sectional design including baseline and 6-month follow-up surveys . METHODS	Schools , stratified according to location , were randomly assigned to intervention ( n = 6 ) or comparison conditions ( n = 12 ) . METHODS	Public primary schools in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions , Tanzania . METHODS	A total of 2026 sixth and seventh grade pupils ( average age , 14.0 years ) participated at baseline ( 85 % ) and 1785 at follow-up . METHODS	The program was designed to reduce children 's risk of HIV infection and to improve their tolerance of and care for people with AIDS . METHODS	Local teachers and health workers attended a 1-week training workshop before implementing the program over a 2-3-month period ( averaging 20 school hours per class ) . METHODS	Self-reported exposure to AIDS information , communication regarding AIDS ; AIDS knowledge , attitudes towards people with AIDS , attitudes towards having sexual intercourse , subjective norms regarding sexual intercourse , and intention to engage in sexual intercourse . RESULTS	Following this program , intervention pupils reported significantly higher scores for the following outcome measures than pupils attending the comparison schools : AIDS information ( 13.1 versus 10.5 ; P = 0.0001 ) , AIDS communication ( 10.9 versus 7.8 ; P = 0.0001 ) AIDS knowledge ( 14.5 versus 11.5 ; P = 0.0001 ) , attitudes towards people with AIDS ( 9.0 versus 6.7 ; P = 0.0008 ) , subjective norms ( 45.5 versus 43.9 ; P = 0.011 ) , and intention ( 1.3 versus 1.4 ; P = 0.020 ) . RESULTS	No program effect was seen for attitudes towards sexual intercourse ( 47.0 versus 46.3 , P = 0.44 ) . CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate that it is feasible and effective to provide AIDS education for Tanzanian primary school children .

OBJECTIVE	To test the effectiveness of the CHAMP among black South Africans in KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa . METHODS	A randomized control trial was conducted in KwaDedangendlale , South Africa , among youths ( ages 9-13 ) and their families ( 245 intervention families rearing 281 children and 233 control families rearing 298 children ) . METHODS	The CHAMPSA intervention targeted HIV risk behaviors by strengthening family relationship processes as well as targeting peer influences through enhancing social problem solving and peer negotiation skills for youths . RESULTS	Among caregivers in the control and experimental conditions , significant intervention group differences were revealed regarding HIV transmission knowledge , less stigma toward HIV-infected people , caregiver monitoring-family rules , caregiver communication comfort , caregiver communication frequency and social networks . RESULTS	Among youths , data revealed that control and experimental groups were significantly different for children in AIDS transmission knowledge and less stigma toward HIV-infected people . CONCLUSIONS	CHAMPSA enhances a significant number individual , family and community protective factors that can help youths avoid risky behaviors leading to HIV-positive status .

BACKGROUND	Current WHO guidelines recommend antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) initiation at CD4 counts 350 cells/L . BACKGROUND	Increasing this threshold has been proposed , with a primary goal of reducing HIV-1 infectiousness . BACKGROUND	Because the quantity of HIV-1 in plasma is the primary predictor of HIV-1 transmission , consideration of plasma viral load in ART initiation guidelines is warranted . METHODS	Using per-sex-act infectivity estimates and cross-sectional sexual behavior data from 2,484 HIV-1 infected persons with CD4 counts > 350 enrolled in a study of African heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples , we calculated the number of transmissions expected and the number potentially averted under selected scenarios for ART initiation : i ) CD4 count < 500 cells/L , ii ) viral load 10,000 or 50,000 copies/mL and iii ) universal treatment . METHODS	For each scenario , we estimated the proportion of expected infections that could be averted , the proportion of infected persons initiating treatment , and the ratio of these proportions . RESULTS	Initiating treatment at viral load 50,000 copies/mL would require treating 19.8 % of infected persons with CD4 counts > 350 while averting 40.5 % of expected transmissions ( ratio 2.0 ) ; treating at viral load 10,0000 copies/mL had a ratio of 1.5 . RESULTS	In contrast , initiation at CD4 count < 500 would require treating 41.8 % , while averting 48.4 % ( ratio 1.1 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Inclusion of viral load in ART initiation guidelines could permit targeting ART resources to HIV-1 infected persons who have a higher risk of transmitting HIV-1 . CONCLUSIONS	Further work is needed to estimate costs and feasibility .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate HIV incidence and explore evidence for changing sexual behaviour over time among men and women belonging to different socioeconomic groups in rural South Africa . METHODS	A cohort study conducted between 2001 and 2004 ; 3881 individuals aged 14-35 years enumerated in eight villages were eligible . METHODS	At least three household visits were made to contact each eligible respondent at both timepoints . METHODS	Sexual behaviour data were collected in structured , respondent-focused interviews . METHODS	HIV serostatus was assessed using an oral fluid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at each timepoint . RESULTS	Data on sexual behaviour were available from 1967 individuals at both timepoints . RESULTS	A total of 1286 HIV-negative individuals at baseline contributed to the analysis of incidence . RESULTS	HIV incidence was 2.2 / 100 person-years among men and 4.9 / 100 person-years in women , among whom it was highest in the least educated group . RESULTS	Median age at first sex was lower among later birth cohorts . RESULTS	A higher number of previously sexually active individuals reported having multiple partners in the past year in 2004 than 2001 . RESULTS	Condom use with non-spousal partners increased from 2001 to 2004 . RESULTS	Migrant men more often reported multiple partners . RESULTS	Migrant and more educated individuals of both sexes and women from wealthier households reported higher levels of condom use . CONCLUSIONS	HIV incidence is high in rural South Africa , particularly among women of low education . CONCLUSIONS	Some risky sexual behaviours ( early sexual debut , having multiple sexual partners ) are becoming more common over time . CONCLUSIONS	Condom use is increasing . CONCLUSIONS	Existing HIV prevention strategies have only been partly effective in generating population-level behavioural change .

BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge , attitudes and behaviour of university students regarding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) and the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . METHODS	A randomised controlled trial of 530 university students was done using peer-adult facilitators . METHODS	Participants completed a questionnaire before and after the intervention , which was a four-hour group session . METHODS	A prevention programme was developed by local experts , health educators and peer facilitators . METHODS	The peer-adult-led programme was designed to provide a conceptual model of HIV risk reduction through information , motivational and behavioural skills , a harm reduction module and health promotion theme . RESULTS	The main outcome measured was the level of knowledge , attitudes and behaviour scores . RESULTS	The results suggest that relative to the control group , participants in the intervention group had higher levels of knowledge ( 30.37 vs. 25.40 ; p-value is 0.001 ) and a better attitude ( 12.27 vs. 10.84 ; p-value is 0.001 ) . RESULTS	However , there was no difference in the behavioural score ( 9.47 vs. 9.41 ; p-value is 0.530 ) . RESULTS	The correlation between the level of knowledge and age and the level of education was found in the intervention group , but not in the control group ( p-value is 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Attitude and gender were found to be correlated in the intervention group only ( p-value is 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Our programme was successful in increasing knowledge and improving attitudes towards AIDS and HIV . CONCLUSIONS	However , it did not improve risk-taking behaviour . CONCLUSIONS	Peer-adult-led educational programmes for youth using various interactional activities , such as small group discussions , poster activity and empathy exercises , can be successful in changing the prevailing youth perceptions of AIDS and HIV .

BACKGROUND	More new HIV-1 infections occur within stable HIV-1-discordant couples than in any other group in Africa , and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) may increase transmission risk among discordant couples , accounting for a large proportion of new HIV-1 infections . BACKGROUND	Understanding correlates of STIs among discordant couples will aid in optimizing interventions to prevent HIV-1 transmission in these couples . METHODS	HIV-1-discordant couples in which HIV-1-infected partners were HSV-2-seropositive were tested for syphilis , chlamydia , gonorrhea , and trichomoniasis , and HIV-1-uninfected partners were tested for HSV-2 . METHODS	We assessed sociodemographic , behavioral , and biological correlates of a current STI . RESULTS	Of 416 couples enrolled , 16 % were affected by a treatable STI , and among these both partners were infected in 17 % of couples . RESULTS	A treatable STI was found in 46 ( 11 % ) females and 30 ( 7 % ) males . RESULTS	The most prevalent infections were trichomoniasis ( 5.9 % ) and syphilis ( 2.6 % ) . RESULTS	Participants were 5.9-fold more likely to have an STI if their partner had an STI ( P < 0.01 ) , and STIs were more common among those reporting any unprotected sex ( OR = 2.43 ; P < 0.01 ) and those with low education ( OR = 3.00 ; P < 0.01 ) . RESULTS	Among HIV-1-uninfected participants with an HSV-2-seropositive partner , females were significantly more likely to be HSV-2-seropositive than males ( 78 % versus 50 % , P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS	Treatable STIs were common among HIV-1-discordant couples and the majority of couples affected by an STI were discordant for the STI , with relatively high HSV-2 discordance . CONCLUSIONS	Awareness of STI correlates and treatment of both partners may reduce HIV-1 transmission . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00194519 .

BACKGROUND	AIDS-defining events ( ADEs ) decreased in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy but still lead to hospitalizations and deaths . BACKGROUND	Understanding factors related to ADEs is important to mitigate events . METHODS	We examined the relationship between demographics , behaviors , comorbidities , laboratory , clinical measurements , and ADEs diagnosed among subjects randomized to antiretroviral treatments ( ART ) / strategies and followed prospectively . METHODS	Logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations generated odds ratios ( ORs ) focusing on the relationship between current CD4 T-cell count ( CD4 ) / HIV-1 RNA viral load ( VL ) and ADEs in the subsequent 16-week study period . RESULTS	Among the 2948 subjects in the analysis , overall incidence of ADEs was 1.53 per 100 person-years . RESULTS	Multivariate regression models adjusted for demographics , body mass index , and ADE history . RESULTS	A 6-level time-varying variable examined VL ( > 100,000 copies/mL , < or = 100,000 ) at CD4 levels ( 0-50 , 51-200 , > 200 cells/microL ) ; reference level was CD4 > 200/VL < or = 100,000 . RESULTS	Among ART naives , odds of having an ADE in the subsequent 16-week interval were greater among subjects with lower CD4 counts ; this relationship was modified by VL level ( CD4 < or = 50/VL > 100,000 : OR 37.2 ; CD4 < or = 50/VL < or = 100,000 : OR 30.5 ; CD4 51-200 / VL > 100,000 : OR 13.0 ; CD4 51-200 / VL < or = 100,000 : OR 4.5 ; all P values < 0.001 ) . RESULTS	Similar results were seen among ART-experienced subjects . CONCLUSIONS	Recent CD4 and VL values are closely associated with development of ADEs even after examining a multitude of potential factors .

BACKGROUND	Despite recent decreases in HIV incidence in many sub-Saharan African countries , there is little evidence that specific behavioural interventions have led to a reduction in HIV among young people . BACKGROUND	Further and wider-scale decreases in HIV require better understanding of when behaviour change occurs and why . BACKGROUND	The MEMA kwa Vijana adolescent sexual and reproductive health intervention has been implemented in rural Mwanza , Tanzania since 1999 . BACKGROUND	A long-term evaluation in 2007/8 found that the intervention improved knowledge , attitudes to sex and some reported risk behaviours , but not HIV or HSV2 prevalence . BACKGROUND	The aim of this paper was to assess the differential impact of the intervention according to gender , age , marital status , number of years of exposure and time since last exposure to the intervention . METHODS	In 2007 , a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the 20 trial communities among 13,814 young people ( 15-30 yrs ) who had attended intervention or comparison schools between 1999 and 2002 . METHODS	Outcomes for which the intervention had an impact in 2001 or 2007 were included in this subgroup analysis . METHODS	Data were analysed using cluster-level methods for stratified cluster-randomised trials , using interaction tests to determine if intervention impact differed by subgroup . RESULTS	Taking into account multiplicity of testing , concurrence with a priori hypotheses and consistency within the results no strong effect-modifiers emerged . RESULTS	Impact on pregnancy knowledge and reported attitudes to sex increased with years of exposure to high-quality intervention . CONCLUSIONS	The desirable long-term impact of the MEMA kwa Vijana intervention did not vary greatly according to the subgroups examined . CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that the intervention can have an impact on a broad cross-section of young people in rural Mwanza . BACKGROUND	ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00248469 .

OBJECTIVE	This article examines gender differences in attitudes toward sexual risk-taking behaviors of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) - orphaned youth participating in a randomized control trial testing an economic empowerment intervention in rural Uganda . METHODS	Adolescents ( average age 13.7 years ) who had lost one or both parents to AIDS from 15 comparable schools were randomly assigned to either an experimental ( n = 135 ) or a control condition ( n = 142 ) . METHODS	Adolescents in the experimental condition , in addition to usual care , also received support and incentives to save money toward secondary education . RESULTS	Findings indicate that although adolescent boys and girls within the experimental condition saved comparable amounts , the intervention appears to have benefited girls , in regard to the attitudes toward sexual risk-taking behavior , in a different way and to a lesser extent than boys . CONCLUSIONS	Future research should investigate the possibility that adolescent girls might be able to develop equally large improvements in protective attitudes toward sexual risk taking through additional components that address gendered social norms .

BACKGROUND	There is a lack of effective behavioral interventions for HIV-positive injection drug users ( IDUs ) . BACKGROUND	We sought to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to reduce sexual and injection transmission risk behaviors and to increase utilization of medical care and adherence to HIV medications among this population . METHODS	HIV-positive IDUs ( n = 966 ) recruited in 4 US cities were randomly assigned to a 10-session peer mentoring intervention or to an 8-session video discussion intervention ( control condition ) . METHODS	Participants completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews and had their blood drawn to measure CD4 cell count and viral load at baseline and at 3-month ( no blood ) , 6-month , and 12-month follow-ups . RESULTS	Overall retention rates for randomized participants were 87 % , 83 % , and 85 % at 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively . RESULTS	Participants in both conditions reported significant reductions from baseline in injection and sexual transmission risk behaviors , but there were no significant differences between conditions . RESULTS	Participants in both conditions reported no change in medical care and adherence , and there were no significant differences between conditions . CONCLUSIONS	Both interventions led to decreases in risk behaviors but no changes in medical outcomes . CONCLUSIONS	The characteristics of the trial that may have contributed to these results are examined , and directions for future research are identified .
